For inference, please check `main.ipynb` and `data` for example.

For the calculation of Weight PER, please check `./utils/wper.py`, you can get similarity matrix there as well.

## Set up the environment

1. Install pytorch

2. Install k2

    Please follow the instruction [here](https://k2-fsa.github.io/k2/installation/index.html). 

3. Install other dependencies (very few)

4. Run the code.
